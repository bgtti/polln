## Dockerhub Image
If you encounter any issues building the image locally, a prebuilt version is available on Docker Hub:

üëâ [Docker Hub - bgtti/polln](https://hub.docker.com/r/bgtti/polln)

Pull it with:

```pwsh
   docker pull bgtti/polln
```
You can then run it like this:

```pwsh
   docker run --env-file .env -p 8000:8000 bgtti/polln
```

üí° Make sure you have a `.env` file ready ‚Äî use `.env.docker.example` from the `main_dockerized` branch as a template.

# About this branch

This branch differs from main in the following ways:

1. **.dockeringore**:
Makes sure some files are ignored when the container is built.

2. **.env.docker.example**:
This example env file differs from the .env.example available in the `main` branch. 

3. **docker-compose.yml**:
Defines the multi-container application.

4. **Dockerfile**:
Outlines the steps to create the containerized application environment.

5. **entrypoint.sh**:
Configures the executables that will run after the container is initiated.

6. **requirements.txt**:
Some requirements were commented out, so this file is not exactly the same as the one in the `main` branch.
Specifically: only the `mysql-connector-python` is needed, as the other connectors would not be suitable for this branch.
The following requirements were removed: mysql==0.0.3, mysqlclient==2.1.1, and PyMySQL==1.0.3.

7. **mydb.py**:
This branch runs MySQL on docker, so this file was removed in this branch.
It is required in the `main` branch to create the db locally.

## Working with this branch

Working with this branch offers some benefits:
üí° No virtual environment needed!
üí° No local MySQL needed!

If you make changes to the source code, changes are instantly reflected.
üí° Just restart the container (or even sometimes just reload the browser), no need to rebuild, just refresh the browser.

When you need to rebuild the container:
- If you change the Dockerfile
- Add/change requirements.txt
- Change the Python version or install system/Python packages

```pwsh
   docker-compose up --build
```

Will data persist between runs?
Yes, volumes are set.
So will the data persist if you run certain docker commends?
```pwsh
   docker-compose stop # yes
   docker-compose down # yes
   docker-compose down --volumes # no
```
